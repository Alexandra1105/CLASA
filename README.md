# CLASA - Clouds for NASA

Crowdsourcing of contrail data, using an online reporting tool. The tool allows users to report contrail sightings, upload a picture of the contrail, and see nearby flight paths and airports. A machine learning backend allows for classification of contrails vs. cloud, for data verification and later development into a recognition tool for publically available webcam feeds.

#### // TODO
+ Connect web dashboard to machine learning backend
+ Complete camera upload functionality
+ Consume FlightStats API for real time aircraft tracking
